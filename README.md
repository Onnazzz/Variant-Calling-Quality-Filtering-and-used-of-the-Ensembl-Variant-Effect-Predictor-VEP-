# Variant Calling, Quality Filtering, and Utilization of Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor (VEP)

The Practice_Onna.html file, is the final report of the practice.

Objectives:

Replicate the findings of the original paper by performing variant calling, quality filtering, and using Ensembl VEP to predict variant consequences.

  -Familiarization and processing of Fasta, BAM, VCF, BCF files. 

  -Use of bioinformatic tools; samtools, bcftools. 

  -Using the Ensembl Perl API.



Paper abstract: 

Kok et al. (2012): Laboratory evolution of new lactate transporter genes in a jen1D mutant of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and their identification as ADY2 alleles by whole-genome resequencing and transcriptome analysis. FEMS Yeast Res, 12:359-74.

Wild-type laboratory strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, like the reference strain S288C or the widely used strain CEN.PK113-7D can grow on a variety of carbon sources including lactate.

In a recent publication1, a knock-out mutant strain based on CEN.PK113-7D was generated, in which the gene for the only known lactate transporter in yeast, jen1, is disrupted by an inserted reporter cassete. As expected, this strain cannot use lactate as a carbon source. Laboratory evolution was used then on this strain to obtain two substrains that had regained the ability to grow on lactate. Both substrains, IMW004 and IMW005, were subjected to WGS to gain insight into the genomic changes that these strains had undergone compared to CEN.PK113-7D over ~100 generations of laboratory evolution and that might explain their ability to grow on lactate despite the disruption of the jen1 gene.

Strikingly, the substrains harbored independent point mutations in the acetate transporter gene ADY2 and subsequent experiments showed that these mutations are likely to cause changes in the substrate specificity of this transporter.
